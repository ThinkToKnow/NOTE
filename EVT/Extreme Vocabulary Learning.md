# Extreme Vocabulary Learning

Extreme Vocabulary Learning (EVoL) - a novel visual-semantic embedding framework.

The unseen classes in the open-set recognition can be seen as extreme values of training(seen) classes.

Using the margin and coverage distribution to model the training(seen) classes.

The EVoL embeds the visual features into semantic space in a probabilistic way.
